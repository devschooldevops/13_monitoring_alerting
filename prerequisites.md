All commands were tested on a Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. If you choose to use another distribution, you might need to check appropriate commands to get the same result. 

1. Have access to an unrestricted Ubuntu server.
I got mine from https://www.digitalocean.com but you can use other providers as long as they donâ€™t have extra firewall configuration that may interfere with this demo.

3. You will need to have root access
4. To be able to do the DNS configuration part, you also need to have a domain purchased in advance.

If you opt in to use DigitalOcean option: 
- you may want to request the account a few days prior to this course, as it needs a manual validation in activation the account.

1. Go to https://cloud.digitalocean.com/ and from top right, select "Create Droplets"
